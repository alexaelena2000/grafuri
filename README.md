# Undirected and Directed Graphs

In this project, I developed theoretical support for undirected graphs and oriented on a .NET platform in the C # language integrating connected database elements in the SQL language. The purpose of the application is to learn the basics of graphs, being applied through practical exercises. At the end of the project, I did a test to verify knowledge when leaving the application. Following the project, I deepened my knowledge of XML files, visual graphics, but also data storage, including their management.
